Running Clusters Locally
==============
Based on your clustering needs, we support several providers for users to run clusters locally.

The simplest way is to play or develop with CloudTik on a single node with virtual clustering
using containers with virtual provider.

If you have multiple local nodes and want to run a single cluster,
you can choose local provider.

If you have multiple local nodes and want to run multiple clusters,
you need to choose on-premise provider.

* Virtual: virtual clustering using docker containers on a single node
* Local: local clustering with multiple nodes
* On-premise: cloud simulating on on-premise nodes
